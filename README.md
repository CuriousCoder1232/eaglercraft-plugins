# eaglercraft-plugins
A list of Bukkit plugins tested and compatible with Eaglercraft

Every plugin has a folder, the folder contains the JAR file containing the plugin which you can copy to your bukkit server's `/plugins` directory and the folder also contains the configuration directory containing the configuration recommended for using the plugin with Eaglercraft which you can also copy (the folder not the files inside) into your `/plugins` directory.

To make things easier, every plugin has a ZIP file in it's directory so you can easily download both the plugin and all of it's config files in basically a single click

**If you are looking to keep your server as secure as possible, do not use the existing config directory for the plugin you download and create your own instead, I cannot guarantee that the config files provided for each plugin will be safe and secure to use on all public servers**

To add a plugin, create a pull request containing the new plugin and it's configuration directory but **do not include a ZIP file** because I will create the ZIP myself to ensure it actually contains the same legitimate plugin and config files reviewed in the pull request
